Welcome!
======
I am a fourth-year PhD student in the department of Linguistics at the University of Toronto. My research interests are predominantly in sociophonetics and queer linguistics, although I've also been known to work in psycholinguistics (namely, child language acquisition) and heritage languages.

My current work focuses on a phenomenon known as phonetic convergence: a form of phonetic imitation where conversational partners begin to sound more (or sometimes less!) phonetically similar to each other. More specifically, this work investigates how gender non-conforming individuals may or may not uniquely utilize this phenomenon in different social contexts in order to index their identities. This includes how different identity intersectionalities (e.g., race, neurodivergence, etc.) may or may not affect this utilization.

Related to queer linguistics, I also look at how children interpret/comprehend ambiguous pronouns that are not strictly associated with binary gender (e.g., singular *they*), and how this compares to adult individuals. Additionally, I am interested in the portrayals of gender nonconforming characters in fictional media (e.g., video games) and how the voices of these characters are constructed in order to index (or avoid indexing) gender nonconformity.
