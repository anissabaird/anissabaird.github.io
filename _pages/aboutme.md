I was born and raised in the Greater Toronto Area. I received my BSc (Hons), majoring both in Computer Science and Linguistics, in 2020 and my MA in Linguistics in 2021, both at the University of Toronto.

When not focusing on linguistics, my interests include knitting/crocheting, music (both listening and playing), board games, tabletop RPGs such as D&D, and my rabbit Sir Mortimer Fluffernutter (Morty, for short).
